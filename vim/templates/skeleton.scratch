# This is a scratch file. It's not meant to be saved on its own, just to write quick stuff on it.
# If you do want to save what you write here, type :w <new_file_name> in normal mode.
# NOTE: Scratch files are now saved in the /tmp folder.
# This means that they will be deleted when the system reboots.
