Light themes are easier on the eyes when sun is up.
But when it's dark around - you better to use dark theme.
This package makes process of switching between light and dark
theme as easy as hitting single keystroke.
Features:

* Choose which one to run by default
* Switch between them with a single keypress
* Easily roll back to default Emacs theme in case of messed faces

Example configuration:
Default is 'light
(setq heaven-and-hell-theme-type 'dark)
