company-prescient.el provides an interface for using prescient.el
to sort Company completions. To enable its functionality, turn on
`company-prescient-mode' in your init-file or interactively.

Note that company-prescient.el does not change the filtering
behavior of Company. This is because that can't be done without
updating each Company backend individually.
