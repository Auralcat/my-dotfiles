This is an improved and somewhat rewritten version of
`emacs-emoji-cheat-sheet' from Shingo Fukuyama

Features available only in this version are:
- emoji buffer has its own major-mode
- automatic display of emoji code in the minibuffer while browsing the
  emoji buffer
- new minor mode `emoji-cheat-sheet-plus-display-mode' which replaces
  emoji codes in buffer by the corresponding image
- new function `emoji-cheat-sheet-plus-insert' to insert an emoji at point
  using an helm front-end. It is possible to insert several emoji with helm
  persistent action mechanism or multiple selection.

This version is stand-alone and does not require the original package
`emacs-emoji-cheat-sheet'.

Configuration
(add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/emacs-emoji-cheat-sheet-plus")
(require 'emoji-cheat-sheet-plus)
