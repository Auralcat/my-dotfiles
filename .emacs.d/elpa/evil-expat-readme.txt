commands, which a vim user is likely to be familiar with.

:remove       remove current file and its buffer; like vim-eunuch's :Remove
:rename       rename or move current file and its buffer; lime vim-eunuch's :Rename
:reverse      reverse visually selected lines
:colorscheme  change Emacs color theme; like vim's ex command of the same name
:diff-orig    get a diff of unsaved changes; like vim's common `:DiffOrig` from the official example vimrc
