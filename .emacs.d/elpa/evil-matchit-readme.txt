This program emulates matchit.vim by Benji Fisher.
It allows you press % to match items.
See https://github.com/redguardtoo/evil-matchit/ for help.

You can turn on `evilmi-always-simple-jump' to match brackets at first.
Thus you disable our *advanced algorithm* which I highly recommend.
Some people may prefer simpler algorithm in `python-mode'.

This program requires EVIL (http://gitorious.org/evil)
