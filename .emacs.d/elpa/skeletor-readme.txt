Skeletor provides project templates for Emacs. It also automates the
mundane parts of setting up a new project like version control, licenses
and tooling.

Skeletor comes with a number of predefined templates and allows you to
easily create your own.

To create a new project interactively, run 'M-x skeletor-create-project'.

To define a new project, create a project template inside
`skeletor-user-directory', then configure the template with the
`skeletor-define-template' macro.

See the info manual for all the details.
