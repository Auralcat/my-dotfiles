This package is a utility for using and formatting various Icon
fonts within Emacs.  Icon Fonts allow you to propertize and format
icons the same way you would normal text.  This enables things such
as better scaling of and anti aliasing of the icons.

This package was inspired by

- `mode-icons' for Emacs, found at https://github.com/ryuslash/mode-icons
- `file-icons' for Atom, found at https://atom.io/packages/file-icons

Currently, this package provides an interface to the following Icon Fonts

- Atom File Icons,       found at https://atom.io/packages/file-icons
- FontAwesome Icons,     found at http://fontawesome.io/
- GitHub Octicons,       found at http://octicons.github.com
- Material Design Icons, found at http://google.github.io/material-design-icons/
- Weather Icons,         found at https://erikflowers.github.io/weather-icons/
- AllTheIcons,           a custom Icon Font maintained as part of this package

Requests for new icons will be accepted and added to the AllTheIcons Icon Font
