table For basic stylingâ€”light padding and only horizontal dividers.\nIt may seem super redundant, but given the widespread use of tables for other plugins like calendars and date pickers, we've opted to isolate our custom table styles.\n
table-bordered Bordered version
table-condensed Make tables more compact by cutting cell padding in half.
table-hover Enable a hover state on table rows within a <tbody>
table-responsive Create responsive tables by wrapping any .table in .table-responsive to make them scroll horizontally on small devices (under 768px).\nWhen viewing on anything larger than 768px wide, you will not see any difference in these tables.\n
table-striped Striped tables are styled via the :nth-child CSS selector, which is not available in Internet Explorer 8.
