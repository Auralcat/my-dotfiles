A company front-end

Differences with the built-in front-end:

- Different colors for differents backends.
- Icons associated to functions/variables/.. and their backends
- Display candidate's documentation (support quickhelp-string)
- Not limited by the current window size, buffer's text properties, ..
  (it's better than you might think)
