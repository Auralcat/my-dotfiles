Highlight things at point, selections, enclosing parentheses with different
colors. Fix grumbling issue of highlights being overridden by `hl-line-mode'
and `global-hl-line-mode'.

Of course, there're more advanced features:
* Save highlights and restore them next time Emacs opened.
* Select highlighted things smartly and search forwardly or backwardly.
* Assign highlighting specific faces which makes them always on the top of
  current line highlight.
