This is the README file for the ERC extras.

ERC is a powerful, modular, and extensible IRC client for Emacs.

About
-----

The files included here are those which could not be distributed with
the version of ERC that comes with Emacs 23.  The reasons might include:

 - No copyright disclaimer was completed for an author of the file.
 - Depends on files which are not distibuted with Emacs.

Installation
------------

There are several ways to tell Emacs where to find these files.  The
easiest may perhaps be to copy them to "~/elisp/erc-extras", and then
to add the line

  (add-to-list 'load-path "~/elisp/erc-extras" t)

to your ~/.emacs (or ~/.emacs/init.el) file.  Compiling them would be
overkill.

License information
-------------------

These extras for ERC are available under the terms of the GNU General
Public License.  See the file `COPYING' for details.
